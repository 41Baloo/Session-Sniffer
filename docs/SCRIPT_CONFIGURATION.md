# Configuration Guide

## Script Settings Configuration

Before proceeding, ensure you are using Windows 10 or above.

Additionally, make sure you have [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) (v4.2.9) installed on your system.

Furthermore, for packet sniffing functionality, you'll require either [Npcap](https://nmap.org/npcap/) or [Winpcap](https://www.winpcap.org/).  
It's worth noting that this step can be omitted as [Npcap](https://nmap.org/npcap/) is already included by default within the [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) installation.

To edit the script settings, open the `Settings.ini` file.  
This file is created upon the first script launch and automatically updates thereafter.

Please note that any changes made to the file will take effect only after restarting the script.  
If unsure about a setting, remove its line. The script will analyze the file and reset missing settings to defaults upon restart.

For detailed explanations of each setting, **click to expand below:**

<details>
<summary>ðŸ“– Settings Details (Click to Expand/Collapse)</summary>

* `<CAPTURE_TSHARK_PATH>`

### Scan trough a VPN

When using a VPN, make sure that you scan from your actual VPN interface.  
Additionally, ensure that in the `Settings.ini` file, the setting `<CAPTURE_NETWORK_INTERFACE_CONNECTION_PROMPT>` is set to `True` value.

### Scan for a console

In order to scan for a console (PS3/PS4/PS5 and Xbox 360/Xbox One/Xbox Series X), you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Open the `Settings.ini` file.
2. If not already done, set `<CAPTURE_NETWORK_INTERFACE_CONNECTION_PROMPT>` to `True` value, so that it forces entering the "Capture network interface selection" screen at script's startup. (you can disable it later)
3. Enable the `<CAPTURE_ARP>` setting by setting its value to `True`. (This setting allows you to view all currently connected external devices within your local network in the script's "Capture network interface selection" screen)
4. Ensure that your console is currently running and **connected to internet through your PC's internet connection (Wired / Hotspot)**.
5. Start the script and wait for it to enter the "Capture network interface selection" screen.
6. Then, you'll need to identify the console's IP and MAC Address and select it accordingly.

### Resolving Country, City and ASN / ISP IP Lookup fields

The script relies on the free [MaxMindâ€™s GeoLite2 databases](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geolite2-free-geolocation-data) to resolve these informations.  
Upon startup, it automatically attempts to check for updates and downloads the latest version from the [PrxyHunter/GeoLite2](https://github.com/PrxyHunter/GeoLite2) repository.

In the event that this repository is deleted, you will need to manually download the following MaxMind GeoLite2 databases: `GeoLite2-ASN.mmdb`, `GeoLite2-City.mmdb` and `GeoLite2-Country.mmdb`.  
You can obtain copies of these databases by signing up for GeoLite2 on the [MaxMind](https://www.maxmind.com/) official website and downloading them from there.  
Then you will need to place the database files into the existing `GeoLite2 Databases` folder within the script's directory.

Please note that I am not allowed to publicly distribute their databases in my project due to their strict [license](https://www.maxmind.com/en/site-license-overview).  
You must obtain it directly from [MaxMind](https://www.maxmind.com/) website.

### Resolving other IP Lookup fields

The script relies on the free [IP-API website](https://ip-api.com/) to resolve these informations.  
No action is required, as the script handles this process seamlessly.  
It allows up to 1500 IP resolutions per minute.

## UserIP INI databases Configuration

### What's an UserIP database ?

A UserIP database tracks users by linking their in-game usernames to their IP addresses.

In earlier versions, the script used a single database, `Blacklist.ini, for blacklisting users.  
Since [v1.1.8](https://github.com/BUZZARDGTA/Session-Sniffer/releases/tag/v1.1.8), you can create multiple lists with custom behaviors to better suit your needs.

By default, these lists are generated the first time the script runs:

* Blacklist.ini: Highlights users in red and suspends the GTA5 process as a protection.
* Enemylist.ini: Highlights users in yellow and notifies you when they join the session.
* Friendlist.ini: Highlights users in green while keeping voice notifications about them.
* Randomlist.ini: Highlights users in white while suppressing notifications about them.
* Searchlist.ini: Highlights users in white and tracks whose IPs you are searching for.

Throughout these INI files, any text following a `;` or `#` symbol is treated as a comment.  
This allows you to add notes or explanations without affecting the script's functionality.

In the folder named `UserIP Databases` add any *.ini files for the script to read.  
To create these files, follow these guidelines:

### UserIP Settings

These are settings specific for each UserIP database files configuration.

For detailed explanations of each UserIP database settings, **click to expand below:**

<details>
<summary>ðŸ“– UserIP Database Settings Details (Click to Expand/Collapse)</summary>

* `<ENABLED>`  
Determine if you want or not to enable this UserIP database.

* `<COLOR>`  
Determine which color will be applied on the script's output for these users.
Valid values are either one of the following colors:  
`BLACK`, `RED`, `GREEN`, `YELLOW`, `BLUE`, `MAGENTA`, `CYAN`, `WHITE`

* `<NOTIFICATIONS>`  
Determine if you want or not to display a notification when a user is detected.

* `<VOICE_NOTIFICATIONS>`  
This setting determines the voice that will play when a user is detected or when they disconnect.  
Valid values are either `Male` or `Female`.  
Set it to `False` to disable this setting.

* `<LOG>`  
Determine if you want or not to log the user in the UserIP logging file.

* `<PROTECTION>`  
Determine if you want or not a protection when a user is found.  
Valid values include any of the following protections:  
`Suspend_Process`, `Exit_Process`, `Restart_Process`, `Shutdown_PC`, `Restart_PC`  
Set it to `False` value to disable this setting.

* `<PROTECTION_PROCESS_PATH>`  
The file path of the process that will be used for the `<PROTECTION>` setting.  
Please note that UWP apps are not supported.

* `<PROTECTION_RESTART_PROCESS_PATH>`  
The file path of the process that will be started when  
the `<PROTECTION>` setting is set to the `Restart_Process` value.  
Please note that UWP apps are not supported.

* `<PROTECTION_SUSPEND_PROCESS_MODE>`  
Specifies the duration (in seconds) for which the `<PROTECTION_PROCESS_PATH>` process will be suspended when `<PROTECTION>` is set to `Suspend_Process`.  
    * Floating-point number: Specify a duration in seconds (e.g., 2.5 for 2.5 seconds).  
    * `Auto`: Keep the process suspended as long as the IP is detected in the session.  
    * `Manual`: Suspend the process indefinitely until the user manually resumes it.

### UserIP Entries

You need to list the entries under the `[UserIP]` section of the INI file in this format:  
`<USERNAME>=<IP>`

### Example UserIP file:
```
[Settings]
ENABLED=True
COLOR=RED
LOG=True
NOTIFICATIONS=True
VOICE_NOTIFICATIONS=Male
PROTECTION=False
PROTECTION_PROCESS_PATH=E:\Games\GTAV\GTA5.exe
PROTECTION_RESTART_PROCESS_PATH=D:\Desktop\Grand Theft Auto V.url
PROTECTION_SUSPEND_PROCESS_MODE=Auto

[UserIP]
username1=0.0.0.0
username2=127.0.0.1
username3=255.255.255.255
```
