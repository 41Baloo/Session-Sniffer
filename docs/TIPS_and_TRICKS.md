## GTA V Tips and Tricks

- The GTA V game port is `6672`; unfortunately, I don't have any clue what the other ports mean.
- Most of the time, when joining a new session, the host is typically the player whose "First Seen" field in the connected players output shows the oldest date and time.

## Obtaining / Resolving someones IP address

- If somebody joins the session, you can obtain their IP address from the most recent entry in "connected players" list.
- If somebody leaves the session, you can obtain their IP address from the most recent entry in "disconnected players" list.
- One way to obtain someone's IP address is by saving all entries from the "connected players" list during the current session.<br>
  Save each IPs under the in-game username(s) you are tracking in the `UserIP Databases\Searchlist.ini` file.<br>
  In a future session, if you receive a notification from the searchlist database and the person you're searching for is in your session, it confirms that you have successfully obtained their IP address.
- A similar method to the above one is that you can notice when someone has been flagged as disconnected and reconnected to your session by monitoring the "Rejoins" field.<br>
  This can help you track a player who has been seen in another session, or joined your session again.
- You can invite them to your private lobby; in this case, the only IP address displayed will be that of your victim.
- Analyzing country information can pinpoint the victim if only one person matches their country.<br>
  You can view someone's country if they have publicly provided it on their Rockstar Games Social Club profile.<br>
  To do so, visit this address: https://socialclub.rockstargames.com/member/Player_Username/ and replace 'Player_Username' with their actual username.
- If you're playing on PC and want to obtain someone's IP address, if they are indexed on this website, you can try using [gtaresolver.com](https://gtaresolver.com/) website to resolve someone's IP address from their in-game username.
