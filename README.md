- Players currently in your session.
- Players who have left or rejoined your session.

## About Usernames Decryption/Resolving

The script **does not decrypt or resolve usernames**\* but allows manual assignment via UserIP database files.  
This functionality used to be possible on old-gen consoles (PS3 and Xbox 360) but has been patched in next-gen.  

\*_As of v1.1.4, username detection for GTA V (PC) is supported via these **mod menu** plugins:_
