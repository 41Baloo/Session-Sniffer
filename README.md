## üîê About Usernames Decryption/Resolving

The script **does not decrypt or resolve usernames automatically**\*.  
This functionality was available on PS3 and Xbox 360 but is patched on current-gen platforms.  
However, it does allow for manual assignment using [UserIP INI databases Configuration](https://github.com/BUZZARDGTA/Session-Sniffer/wiki/Configuration-Guide#userip-ini-databases-configuration) files.

\*_As of v1.1.4, username detection for GTA V (PC) is supported via these **mod menu** plugins:_
- ~~_[Session Sniffer 2Take1 Lua Plugin](https://github.com/BUZZARDGTA/GTA_V_Session_Sniffer-plugin-2Take1-Lua)_~~ \[ARCHIVED\]
- _[Session Sniffer Stand Lua Plugin](https://github.com/BUZZARDGTA/GTA_V_Session_Sniffer-plugin-Stand-Lua)_
- _[Session Sniffer Cherax Lua Plugin](https://github.com/BUZZARDGTA/GTA_V_Session_Sniffer-plugin-Cherax-Lua)_
